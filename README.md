# Bingo
Daily Bingo Game

This was a casual project to challenge/develop my PS skills.  It is a game that calls upon two lists of words (in .txt files), chooses a random selection from each list, inputs the rules, and then emails each 'player' specified in a third file.  Each 'entry' is a unique selection.  Thanks 'foreach'!

For v2, I should/would develop arrays instead of utilizing .txt files.
